# Housing Whistleblowing App Group B-10

Worked with 4 other people, names removed for privacy reasons.

The files were copied from the original repo as forking is restricted in the organization. We were given explicit permission to copy our code
to personal repositories for portfolio purposes by the instructors of the course. Since it was copied, no changes were made to the final code
submitted for the project, meaning some things may have broken in the process, however everything works fully as intended on the main repo.

This is a Django project that allows users to submit reports for housing related issues.

In this project, I took the role of Scrum Master. I organized and lead our group meetings, figured out what needed to be done for the next sprint,
and assigned work based on people's team roles. Code wise, I created the google login, the system linking users and admins through groups, the admin dashboard,
as well as various other contributions here and there along with bug fixes. The project was originally deployed on [https://housing-app-ae29b1766b91.herokuapp.com/], but
the link may have depreceated if the Heroku bill runs out.

This software allows users to submit reports for issues related to their housing.
They must first join a building group given to them by a building administrator, then they can submit reports to any group they are a part of.
The user can view previous reports and delete them if they desire. 
Administrators can create groups that users join and view the reports that the users create, as well as closing reports opened by  with a admin message.
A user can sign up as either a User or Admin, which they are prompted for the first time they create their account.
There is also another level, called SuperAdmin, which can view the reports of users from all groups.
The SuperAdmin status can only be obtained through the Django Admin page, meaning someone seeking this status should contact the Django administrators.
